Core codecs
-----------

The following documents specify the codecs that Zarr version 3 implementations MUST support. This collection of 
codecs is chosen to form a shared basis for interoperability between Zarr implementations in different languages,
and to ensure that different Zarr implementations consistently implement key Zarr features.

Read more about core codecs in the :ref:`core codecs <core-codecs>` section of the Zarr version 3 specification.
